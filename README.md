# Deep-Learning-Challenge
Design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. Compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy.
